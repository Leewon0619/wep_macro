# Wep Macro Extension

This extension records input events on the current page and can bridge to the Windows desktop app via native messaging.

## Load (Chrome/Edge)
1. Go to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`
2. Enable Developer mode
3. Click "Load unpacked" and choose the `extension` folder

## Native Messaging (optional)
To control the desktop app, a native host must be installed on Windows. This repo only includes the extension scaffold.
